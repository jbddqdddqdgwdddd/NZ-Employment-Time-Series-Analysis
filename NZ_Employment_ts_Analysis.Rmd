### Generate residuals and conduct Ljung-Box analysis
### a) ETS analysis
fit_ets %>%
  gg_tsresiduals()
fit_ets %>%
  augment() %>%
  features(.innov, ljung_box, lag = 10, dof = 3)
## The innovation residuals appear to have constant variance with no outstanding outlier. The innovation residuals appear to be consistent with white noise as there are only 1 slightly significant autocorrelations at lag 11. This is further backed up by the Ljung-Box test that does not reject the null hypothesis of independence.

### b) ARIMA analysis
fit %>%
  select(stepwise) %>%
  gg_tsresiduals()
fit %>%
  select(stepwise) %>%
  augment() %>%
  features(.innov, ljung_box, lag = 10, dof = 3)

##The innovation residuals appear to have constant variance with no outstanding outlier. The innovation residuals appear to be consistent with white noise as there are only 1 slightly significant autocorrelations at lag 11(hard to tell).This is further backed up by the Ljung-Box test that does not reject the null hypothesis of independence.
